Sure, I'd be happy to help you get started with GitHub! Here are some basic steps:

1.  Create a GitHub account: Go to [https://github.com/](https://github.com/) and sign up for a free account.
    
2.  Create a new repository: Once you are logged in, click on the '+' icon located in the top right corner of the page and select "New repository". Fill in the repository name and other details. You can choose to make the repository public or private.
    
3.  Set up Git on your computer: Install Git on your computer and configure it with your username and email address.
    
4.  Clone the repository: Clone the repository on your local machine using the `git clone` command.
    
5.  Add, commit and push your changes: Once you have made changes to your local files, add the changes using the `git add` command, commit the changes using the `git commit` command and push the changes to the remote repository using the `git push` command.
    
6.  Create a pull request: If you are working with other people, you can create a pull request to request that they review and merge your changes. To create a pull request, click on the "New pull request" button in your repository.
    

This is just a basic overview of how to use GitHub. There is a lot more that you can do with the platform, including using issues to track bugs and feature requests, contributing to open source projects, and collaborating on projects with other people. I recommend checking out the GitHub documentation for more in-depth information and tutorials.
